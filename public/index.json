Above, we have created a connection to the public instance without opening SSH port 22, for better security, avoiding any attack to the SSH port.\nOne disadvantage of the above method is that we have to open the Security Group outbound at port 443 to the internet. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a public instance, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, but if you want extra security, you can block port 443 to the internet and still use the Session Manager.

	"content": "GuardDuty - Overview Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior across your AWS environment. GuardDuty combines machine learning (ML), anomaly detection, and malicious file discovery, using both AWS and industry-leading third-party sources to help protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data. GuardDuty is capable of analyzing tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, including AWS CloudTrail logs, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Flow Logs, and DNS query logs. GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data events, Amazon Aurora login events, and runtime activity for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)—including serverless container workloads on AWS Fargate.\nGuardDuty gives you accurate threat detection of compromised accounts, which can be difficult to detect quickly if you are not continuously monitoring factors in near real time. GuardDuty can detect signs of account compromise, such as AWS resource access from an unusual geolocation at an atypical time of day. For programmatic AWS accounts, GuardDuty checks for unusual API calls, such as attempts to obscure account activity by disabling CloudTrail logging or taking snapshots of a database from a malicious IP address.\nGuardDuty continuously monitors and analyzes your AWS account and workload event data found in CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. There is no additional security software or infrastructure to deploy and maintain for the foundational protections in GuardDuty. By associating your AWS accounts together, you can aggregate threat detection instead of working on an account-by-account basis. In addition, you do not have to collect, analyze, and correlate large volumes of AWS data from multiple accounts. Focus on how to respond quickly, how to keep your organization secure, and continuing to scale and innovate on AWS.\n"

AWS Security Hub summary page From the Summary page, you can see what standards have been enabled in your account, and you can see the number of passed and failed controls per standard. The percentage is the percent of controls in a \u0026ldquo;passed\u0026rdquo; compliance status compared to the number of controls that have a \u0026ldquo;passed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; compliance status. Click on Security standards from the navigation on the left. Standards were enabled using CloudFormation when the workshop was provisioned. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into one of the standards. Click View Results for NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5. Controls From the top of the page, you can select tabs to show only \u0026ldquo;Passed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Failed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Disabled\u0026rdquo;, etc. controls. You can also filter to a control using the search bar that says \u0026ldquo;Filter all enabled controls\u0026rdquo;. Click the search bar and filter on ID. Specify ID = EC2.13. Click on the Title: Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22. This presents a view of all resources evaluated for this particular control and the current status of each resource as it relates to the control. Notice there are some resources with a FAILED status and some with a PASSED status. AWS Security Hub Security Standards provide remediation instructions for each check. At the top of the page click the Remediation instructions link to open guidance in a new tab. Investigating a misconfigured resource Return to the Security Hub control you were looking at. For one of the FAILED resources open Config rule in the Investigate column. This will display links that will take you to AWS Config to view the configuration timeline for this resource or the overall config rule that performed the evaluation on this resource. Click Configuration timeline. This opens AWS Config, and shows the resource configuration timeline for this security group. From here, you can investigate the point in time when the resource became non-compliant by reviewing the timestamped events. If you want, take a minute to expand a couple of the events. Expand a CloudTrail Event listed. Then click CloudTrail under View event. This opens up that event, logged in CloudTrail. AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions. Consolidated controls Return to Security Hub and open General settings page from the navigation panel. https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home?#/settings/general At the top of the page, you should see that both \u0026ldquo;Auto-enable new controls in enabled standards\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Consolidated control findings\u0026rdquo; is enabled.\nClick Controls from the navigation panel. This page shows a similar view to what you reviewed at the standard level, but here you see the full list of consolidated controls. This makes it easier to see how many individual controls in your account are passing, failing, or in some other state. Additionally, with consolidated findings enabled, controls included in multiple enabled standards no longer generate a finding per standard (duplicates). This helps manage the number of findings in your environment and removes potential confusion around duplicate findings.\nInsights In the navigation on the left, click Insights. In the search bar, input \u0026ldquo;severity\u0026rdquo; and select the insight named 24. Severity by counts of findings. Security Hub offers several built-in managed insights. You cannot modify or delete managed insights. 24. Severity by counts of findings is one of the managed insights. Take a minute to review the number of findings in the environment.

You can optionally export the generated findings to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. This will help you to track the historical data of potentially suspicious activities in your account and evaluate whether the recommended remediation steps were successful.\nAny new active findings that GuardDuty generates are automatically exported within about 5 minutes after the finding is generated. You can set the frequency for how often updates to the active findings are exported to EventBridge. The frequency that you select applies to the exporting of new occurrences of existing findings to EventBridge, your S3 bucket (when configured), and Detective (when integrated).\nWhen you configure settings to export findings to an Amazon S3 bucket, GuardDuty uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the findings data in your S3 bucket. This requires you to add permissions to your S3 bucket and the AWS KMS key so that GuardDuty can use them to export findings in your account.\n"
