#### Inspector - Pricing



1. You can review estimated spend in the Amazon Inspector console, including aggregated organization-wide spend in the central Amazon Inspector administrator account. This way, you can understand and estimate the cost of using Amazon Inspector for automated and continual vulnerability scans across EC2, Amazon ECR, and Lambda functions for your entire organization before moving to paid usage.



2. From Inspector, open the **Usage** page from the navigation on the left under General Settings.



3. Review your projected cost. Projected cost is based on account usage for the last 30 days. If the account has been active with Inspector for less than 30 days, we extrapolate the costs for 30 days based on the current usage.
