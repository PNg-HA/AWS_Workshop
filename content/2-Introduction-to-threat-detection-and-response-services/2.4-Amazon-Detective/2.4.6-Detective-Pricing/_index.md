#### Security Hub - Pricing



1. The GuardDuty console indicates how many days are left in the free trial as well as average daily cost (based on volume of data analyzed and scanned), taking the guesswork out of budget planning.


2. From Detective, open the **Usage** page from the navigation on the left under Settings.

3. Review your current trial usage and estimated cost. The estimates displayed in the GuardDuty console may differ slightly than those in your AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/monitoring_costs.html.
