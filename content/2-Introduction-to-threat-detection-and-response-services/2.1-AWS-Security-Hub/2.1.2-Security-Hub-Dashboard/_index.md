2. At the top of the page, review the **Security standards** widget. This displays your most recent summary security score and the security score for each Security Hub standard. Security scores, which range from 0â€“100 percent, represent the proportion of passed controls relative to all of your enabled controls.

3. Take a few minutes to review the insights generated on the Summary page. Can you see which resources in your account are failing the most security checks? One of the widgets provides a summary of the resources that have generated the most findings, broken down by the resource types.
